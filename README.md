## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img alt="HTML5 Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-000000?style=flat&logo=HTML5"></a>

I created 3 different API search websites for each part of the API: characters, transformations, and worlds. The process was the same for all of them so I created 3 different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that correpond to each of them. 

## Optimizations
I had to create my own error since the API I used didn't have the normal errors on there
I made a config js file to create a hashmap of all the different search terms. Since the only way to properly search it was in Spanish
I also had to create code to create a translation for the character bio since it was hard locked to being in Spanish
